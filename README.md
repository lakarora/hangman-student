The rules for Hangman are simple and you can read the details online, for example, at http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29. Typically two players play the game with pencil and paper. Player A thinks
of a word and writes down a sequence of underscores representing the word (the game board) that player B needs to
guess. For example, if player A picks the case-sensitive word heLLo then she would write: An underscore
is used for each letter that has not been guessed yet.
P
Player B will then proceed to guess letters one at a time that might be contained in the unknown word. If a letter that
player B guesses is contained in the word, player A will replace the underscore in the appropriate location with the
letter that player B guessed. For example, if player B guesses ‘L’ then player A would write: L L Note that if
the guessed letter appears in multiple places in the word, each letter is revealed on the game board. If player B guesses
a letter that is not in the word then player A will draw a part of the hangman picture. For example, if player B guesses
an ‘a’ then the result would be: |--------| [L, a] L L , where the |--------| represents the start
of the hangman platform. The [L, a] represents the list of letters that the player has guessed previously. If player B
continues to guess incorrectly she will lose the game with the following being written down by player A:
|-----|
| |
| O
| /|\
| |
| / \
|
|---------|
[L, a, b, C, x, g, P, k, z, m, N, q, w, i]
The word was HeLLo!
You lose!
